# ESP32 LED Blink

This is a simple ESP32 LED Blink project created using the Wokwi simulator.

It demonstrates how to control a GPIO pin on an ESP32 by blinking an LED on and off.

## Live Demo (Wokwi)
https://wokwi.com/projects/452974328969846785

## How it works
The ESP32 sets GPIO pin 5 as an output and continuously turns the LED ON and OFF with a 500ms delay.

## Code
The project uses a simple Arduino-style sketch to blink the LED.

## Tools used
- ESP32
- Wokwi Simulator
- Arduino IDE

## Purpose
This project is created as a beginner-level embedded systems demo and is suitable for learning and interview presentation.
